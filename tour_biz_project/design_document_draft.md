# Tour guides io
This is a SQLite schema for a software-as-a-service (SAAS) co-op company run by a consortium of independent tour guide operators across the United States, and then on further expansion (not this iteration) the world!

Walking tours for independent providers. Bus tours, etc

Tour guide businesses need to list their tours, sell tickets, assign guides, and update their guests. This will provide data for real time calendars with availability, provide multiple pricing options, eventually link to Stripeâ€™s API for payments. 

Businesses will want to take all bookings and manage payments, issue quotes and invoices, and manage all aspects of their business on this. Businesses will also want to book their guides on tours, and provide a calendar, reminder system for employees.

Guides will want to see what tours they are booked for. Also, to see and check in attendees on tours.

Attendees will want to search for interesting tours in a city or location of their choice, and purchase tickets.
